# Getting started

This guide connects a coding tool to your own accounts or API keys through cooker. For Codex CLI with API keys and mixed providers, see [Codex CLI](CLIENTS.md#codex-cli) and the [`api-keys`](CONFIGURATION.md#api-keys) section of the configuration reference.

## 1. Start it

Start the Docker image with a data directory and a dashboard password:

```sh
mkdir -m 700 -p data
sudo chown -R 10001:10001 data
docker run -d --name cooker -p 127.0.0.1:8317:8317 -v "$PWD/data:/data" -e CK_MANAGEMENT_PASSWORD='REPLACE-WITH-A-STRONG-PASSWORD' ghcr.io/prep-cook/cooker:latest
```

[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md#docker) covers the volume, an optional initial `config.yaml` and upgrades. An empty volume starts with the default settings on port 8317 and creates `/data/cooker.db`. If `/data/config.yaml` exists, the first start imports it; later starts use the database. Two settings control access:

- `CK_MANAGEMENT_PASSWORD` (or `management.secret-key` in the imported config) is the dashboard password. Without either, the management API, and therefore the dashboard sign-in, returns 403 for every request.
- An entry under `access.api-keys` is a client key your tools send to the proxy. Add it in the dashboard or in the initial `config.yaml`.

Run `curl http://127.0.0.1:8317/healthz` to check that the server responds.

## 2. Open the dashboard

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8317/management.html> in your browser and sign in with the management key. On a server without a browser, open an SSH tunnel from your own computer first, as described in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md#docker).

On a new server, the Overview shows a short Get started card with three steps: connect an account, point a tool at the proxy, and send a test request. The card disappears after you complete all three steps or dismiss it.

## 3. Connect an account

</picture>

In the dashboard, choose Connect account, then select a provider. Claude and ChatGPT (Codex) open the provider's own sign-in page; Kimi, Meta, xAI and Devin show a device code to enter on their site. The proxy stores sign-in and refresh tokens in SQLite, not in files. It never sees your password.

You can also sign in from a terminal, which is useful on a server without a browser. The running proxy owns its database, so the terminal sign-in goes through the proxy:

```sh
docker exec -it cooker cooker --management-base-url http://127.0.0.1:8317 --claude-login --no-browser
```

When prompted, enter the management key. The prompt does not echo it.

The other sign-in flags are `--codex-login`, `--codex-device-login`, `--kimi-login`, `--meta-login`, `--xai-login` and `--devin-login`. Add API keys for Claude, Codex, Gemini, Vertex AI, xAI and OpenAI-compatible services on the dashboard's Provider keys page.

Check each provider's terms before using a subscription. This setup is for one person using their own accounts on their own machines. Use provider-sanctioned integrations or API keys where available.

## 4. Point a tool at it

  <img src="img/use-light.png" alt="The Use with tools dialog at its Test step: the proxy address, the client key and a passing connection test" width="880">
</picture>

The dashboard's Use with tools dialog, on the Client keys page, shows this server's address and your client key, each with a copy button, and tests the key. For example, to configure Claude Code:

```sh
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8317
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=PASTE-YOUR-CLIENT-KEY
claude
```

[CLIENTS.md](CLIENTS.md) provides setup instructions for Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Amp, OpenCode, Cursor, Cline, Zed, Aider, the SDKs and other clients.

## Running it safely

- Always set `access.api-keys`. With an empty list, anyone who can reach the proxy can use your accounts. The server logs a warning at startup when the list is empty.
- Keep `server.host` on `127.0.0.1` unless other machines need it. An empty host listens on every network interface. To use the proxy from other machines, a private network such as Tailscale is the simplest safe option; see [MULTI-ACCOUNT.md](MULTI-ACCOUNT.md#reach-the-proxy-from-other-machines).
- The management API returns 403 ("management key not set") until `management.secret-key` (or the `CK_MANAGEMENT_PASSWORD` environment variable) is set. With `management.allow-remote: false`, the default, only requests from this computer are accepted. Five wrong keys from one address block that address for 30 minutes.
- Behind a tunnel or reverse proxy on the same machine (cloudflared, `tailscale serve`, Caddy, nginx), every request arrives from `127.0.0.1`, so the server treats every internet client as local. In that case, `allow-remote: false` no longer keeps them out: the server accepts `--password`, which it otherwise takes from loopback clients only, from the internet, and five wrong keys from anyone block the tunnel for everyone. Set `server.trusted-proxies` to the proxy's address, for example `[127.0.0.1, "::1"]` for a local cloudflared, and restart. The server then takes the client address from `X-Forwarded-For` and trusts that header only from that proxy. CLIProxyAPI behaves the same way.
- The dashboard sends the management key once and then holds a session cookie that the page's scripts cannot read. The session lasts 7 days, or 30 days with "Remember on this device". Signing out, changing `management.secret-key` or restarting the server ends it. Behind a reverse proxy, list the proxy in `server.trusted-proxies`: the server then reads its `X-Forwarded-Proto` to mark the cookie `Secure` over HTTPS, and its `X-Forwarded-Host`, which dashboard changes must match when the proxy rewrites `Host`.
- Do not send keys over plain HTTP across a network. Use a tunnel or reverse proxy with HTTPS, or serve HTTPS directly with `server.tls`.
- The dashboard is built into the binary, and cooker never downloads code to run. CLIProxyAPI downloads its dashboard from GitHub every three hours by default. cooker does fetch model lists from the CLIProxyAPI project's mirrors at startup and every three hours, as CLIProxyAPI does. The lists are JSON data, checked before use, and `--local-model` disables the fetch.
- SQLite holds configuration secrets, client keys and OAuth tokens. Keep its directory, published snapshot, temporary working databases and backups private. To make a complete backup, copy the `--db` snapshot directly while the service runs, or use `config backup`. Config revisions do not contain credential state and never restore a revoked token. Logical deletion does not guarantee physical disk erasure. See [database safety](CONFIGURATION.md#database-safety-and-backup).
