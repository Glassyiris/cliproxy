description: A quiet operator console. Grey carries hierarchy; hue carries state.

# Design language: Rosé Pine (Moon/Dawn)

The dashboard is where one person keeps many provider accounts healthy behind one local endpoint.
They come to answer three questions, in this order: can the proxy serve right now, which account
needs me, and what did my tools just send. Every screen is built for scanning a long list and
acting on one row, not for reading.

This replaces the Braun "Instrument" language (2026-11-08, owner: the dashboard gets its own new
style). Product rules in `PRODUCT.md` still apply; its visual and size clauses are superseded here.

## Principles

1. **Grey carries hierarchy, hue carries state.** Surfaces, text and controls are the palette's
   neutral roles. A coloured pixel means a state (ready, cooling, failing, info) or, in iris
   only, the focus ring. Links are body text (as the nbcards admin draws them): a chevron, the
   hover and the button shape show what is clickable.
2. **One way to draw each thing.** One row, one list, one detail panel, one dialog, one form field,
   one notice. Astryx components first; a local component exists only when two screens need it.
3. **Dense, not cramped.** Row height and type follow Astryx's console scale. Numbers use tabular
   figures; identifiers (model IDs, keys, paths, file names) use the mono family.
4. **State is never colour alone.** Every lamp has a word or an accessible label; active navigation
   changes weight and background, not only hue.
5. **Motion reports, it does not decorate.** One motion module, Astryx durations, all off under
   `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Colour

The palette is [Rosé Pine](https://rosepinetheme.com): **Moon** in dark mode and **Dawn** in light
mode by default, with **Rosé Pine** (Main) for dark as the second choice. The values come
unmodified from [rose-pine/palette](https://github.com/rose-pine/palette) (MIT): the named roles
from `palette.json`, the highlight roles from `dist/css/rose-pine.css`; they live in
`src/themes/site/rosePine.ts`. Owner, 2026-11-08: 「https://github.com/rose-pine 配色用這個把」;
「原色優先」 — every colour is an official value; pairs that miss a contrast limit are listed in
`REQUIREMENTS.md` Exceptions instead of being adjusted.

- Theme: both site themes extend Astryx's official neutral theme
  (`defineTheme({extends: neutralTheme})`, as Astryx's setup guide does) and set only colour and
  type-size tokens: fonts, component styles, icons (lucide), radius and motion come from
  neutral. `src/themes/site/siteTheme.ts` builds `site` (Moon, in the entry) and
  `siteMainTheme.ts` builds `site-main` (loaded on demand when chosen), both with
  `astryx theme build`; the colour and type tokens are shared (`roseTokens`). Both modes are
  first-class, following the system by default with a manual switch.
- Palette and mode are separate choices. Mode is one click: a ghost icon button flips light and
  dark relative to what is shown (BoothDex's ColorModeToggle), and until the first press the page
  follows the system. Palette, mode (with "follow the system") and language are set in the
  settings dialog (see Preferences). The choice is stored and applied before the first render.
- Roles, the same for both palettes, following Rosé Pine's own usage table:

  | Dashboard role | Rosé Pine role |
  | --- | --- |
  | Page background | base |
  | Card, side nav surface | surface |
  | Popover, menu, palette, toast; status and accent muted fills | overlay |
  | Hover and selected nav item, neutral badge | highlight med (low measures 1.01–1.12:1 on base and surface) |
  | Hover tint mixed into radios, checkboxes and switches | highlight low |
  | Borders, dividers, skeleton, track | highlight med |
  | Emphasized border (inputs) | highlight high |
  | Body text | text |
  | Secondary text | subtle |
  | Tertiary, placeholder, disabled text | muted |
  | Primary button fill / its label | text / base (ink) |
  | Links | text (the text accent is set to text) |
  | Focus ring | iris |
  | Ready / success | pine |
  | Info | foam |
  | Warning (cooling), yellow Token (warning log level) | gold |
  | Error (failing), red Token (error log level) | love |
  | rose | unused |

- Status vocabulary, closed set: `ready`, `cooling`, `failing`, `info`, `disabled` (muted). A lamp
  is Astryx's `StatusDot` (`success`, `warning`, `error`, `neutral`; `info` is for banners and
  badges only) with its word in secondary text beside it, as the owner's BoothDex console draws
  it (`admin/live-status.tsx`). Icons, lamps and status borders take the hue; banner and badge
  fills are overlay with the hue as their text, so no fill is mixed from a hue. Contrast limits stay: body text ≥ 10:1,
  secondary and status text ≥ 5:1, measured on the composited colour; the official colours miss
  some of them, see `REQUIREMENTS.md`.
- The dialog scrim, the shadow and the hover and pressed overlays drawn over a fill keep Astryx's
  translucent defaults: they are not palette colours, and Rosé Pine defines none.
- Text tokens are not fill tokens. Traffic strips use the neutral roles for volume; gold for a
  bucket where 5 % to 50 % of the requests failed, love from 50 % (fewer failures stay neutral).

## Type

- Fonts are the neutral theme's own, unchanged (owner, 2026-11-08: fonts and icons use the
  component library's defaults): Figtree, then the system sans stack, for body and headings;
  the system monospace stack for code. Neutral's `fonts.css` loads Figtree from Google Fonts at
  run time; the app imports the same four weights from `@fontsource/figtree` instead (in
  `src/themes/site/index.ts`), so it makes no third-party request, as BoothDex does. There is no
  `typography` block and no per-locale font rule, so CJK text falls to the system fonts the
  browser picks for the page language.
- Scale: the nbcards admin's (card-v2 `panelScale`, MIT, the owner's project): `typography.scale`
  base 15, ratio 1.2, in `siteTypography` (`src/themes/site/siteTheme.ts`). Body 15, card title in
  a list 18 (h3), section 22 (h2), page title 26 (h1), metric value 31 (`display-3`); supporting
  text 13 on a 20 px line (`--text-supporting-size`, as card-v2 `panelShared` sets it). Weights are
  400, 500 and 600 only: headings and the metric value are semibold in every locale.
- Controls follow `panelShared`: `--size-element-sm` 32 (row actions, icon buttons with a 16 px
  glyph), `md` 36 (buttons, inputs, nav rows), `lg` 40. Radii 8 / 12 / 16 (inner, element, card).

## Layout

Every screen starts from an Astryx template and keeps its frame (owner, 2026-11-08: build from
the templates and the components as they come; 「這個側邊欄絕對不是組件庫和我的項目有的純ai風格難看死了」;
「內容都要組件庫的」). Each page file names its template in its header comment and lists every
deviation with its reason.

### Routes

Six hash routes (owner, 2026-11-08: 「很多東西沒必要一定是一個頁面」). What used to be a page of its
own is a view of one of them (`?view=`, listed under its route in the side nav, which is a
collapsible category, open by default; in the collapsed rail each view is its own icon) or a
dialog (`?open=`). Pages carry no tab strip (owner, 2026-11-08: header tabs read as 「切換太離譜了」;
「側邊欄可以做之前那種收起」). Sign-in is not a route. The R1 to R5 rewrites
redesign the content of Accounts, Clients, Models, Activity and Settings; until then each tab and
dialog hosts the earlier page unchanged through a thin host in `src/app/pages/`.

| Route (`#id`) | Answers first | Template | Views (side nav) and dialogs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Overview (`overview`) | Can the proxy serve now, and what needs me? | `dashboard-alert-rail` | Three tiles (can serve, requests, failure share); "Needs attention", one card per reason with accounts, each linking to where it is fixed, or one all-clear line; two chart cards. The first attention card is inside the first screen on a phone |
| Accounts (`accounts`) | Which accounts cannot serve, and when do they recover? | `table-inbox` | Views: Accounts, Provider keys (`?view=providers`) |
| Clients (`clients`) | Which key do I use, and how do I revoke one? | `table-page` (minimal) | Dialog: Use with a tool (`?open=use`), from the header and from a key's row menu |
| Models (`models`) | Which models can clients ask for, and where do they go? | `table-filter` | Views: Models, Payload rules (`?view=payload`) |
| Activity (`activity`) | Where does traffic come from, and what happened to a request? | `dashboard-comparison`, `table-filter` | Views: Usage, Logs (`?view=logs`) |
| Settings (`settings`) | Which server setting do I change, and what does it affect? | `settings-sidebar` | Dialog: Plugins (`?open=plugins`), from the header |
| Sign-in (not a route) | Which server do I connect to, and what do I enter? | `login-card` | — |
| Connect an account (dialog over any page, `?open=connect`) | Which kind of account, and how far is the authorization? | `form-wizard-dialog` | After the type is chosen only that flow shows |
| About (preferences dialog, `?open=about`) | Which build is this, and is it current? | `settings-dialog` | The earlier System page, as the dialog's About panel (below) |

- One hash form: `#<route>[/<arg>][?<query>]`. A tab is `?view=<tab>` (the first tab has none); a
  dialog is `?open=<dialog>`; a filter is its own key (`#accounts?show=<reason>`, which Accounts
  reads from R1 on). Logs keeps its own `?tab=`, which is why the route tab is `view`.
- Old hashes land through `redirect()` in `src/lib/hash.ts`, which replaces the entry in place:
  `#providers` → `#accounts?view=providers`, `#keys` → `#clients`, `#use` → `#clients?open=use`,
  `#usage` → `#activity`, `#logs` → `#activity?view=logs`, `#payload` → `#models?view=payload`,
  `#config` and `#configuration` → `#settings`, `#plugins/<name>` → `#settings?open=plugins&plugin=<name>`,
  `#credentials` and `#quotas` → `#accounts`; `#connect`, `#oauth` and `#system` open the connect
  or About dialog over the page shown before (Overview when there is none).
- A hosted dialog is `PageDialog` on the `form-wizard-dialog` frame, 800 wide, not the template's
  620: the hosted pages were laid out for a reading width (`roles.content.formWidth`). Closing it
  drops its own query keys, so the next opening starts clean.
- Filters, tabs, paging and the open item live in the hash query, so Back restores them.
- After sign-in, every route's chunk is fetched when the browser is idle, so the first visit to a
  page does not wait for its chunks. Queries are fresh for 30 s (`src/app/queryClient.ts`); a
  page entered again shows its cached data while it refetches, and polling queries keep their own
  interval.

### Shell (`shell-side-nav`, as BoothDex's admin shell)

The precedent is the owner's BoothDex console, `web/src/components/admin/admin-shell.tsx`, itself
built from the same template.

- Astryx `AppShell` with the side nav only; there is no top bar. `SideNav` is `collapsible` and
  `resizable` (260 px default, 220 to 360).
- Header: `SideNavHeading` with the brand mark and "cliproxy-rs", linking to the first page.
- Body: one untitled `SideNavSection` with the six pages in `src/app/routes.ts` order, each a
  `SideNavItem` with its lucide icon; no groups, no group headers and no children (with six items
  they are noise). The current page is Astryx's own selected item. `Network` is the brand mark and
  never a nav icon.
- Collapsed rail: every page is one icon that navigates on click, its name as `SideNavItem`'s own
  tooltip on hover and keyboard focus; no flyout or submenu exists. Tab reaches each icon in order
  and Enter navigates. The width and the collapsed state persist through `resizable.autoSaveId`
  (Astryx reads and writes localStorage in try/catch), a per-viewer convenience.
- Footer (`SideNavSection isHeaderHidden`): the connection row (host with its `StatusDot`; a
  popover gives the lamp, version and commit), "Go to page" (`CommandPalette`, also Ctrl/Cmd+K,
  lists the pages and, under them, their tabs and dialogs; SideNav has no search slot), GitHub (new tab) and Sign
  out.
- Footer icon row (`SideNav footerIcons`, beside the collapse button, the slot SideNav keeps in
  the collapsed rail): the colour-mode toggle and the settings button, each a ghost icon button
  with a tooltip.
- Phones (below Astryx `md`): AppShell's own phone bar and drawer, nothing hand-built; the bar
  carries the heading and the footer icon row.
- After sign-in and after every page change, focus moves to the page's h1 without a ring.

### Preferences

- The settings button opens the `settings-dialog` template. Appearance: palette (with a preview),
  mode (light, dark, follow the system) and language. Keyboard shortcuts: the template's own panel
  (`settings-dialog/page.tsx:413`). Options that affect only this browser sit in the dialog too.
- The About panel (the earlier System page, below) is the dialog's last panel, opened directly by
  `?open=about`.
- Server settings, which affect everyone, stay on the Settings page and never enter the dialog.
- Sign-in keeps its own mode, palette and language controls at the page's top end, on the page
  gutter, because the side nav is not there yet.

### Sign-in (`login-card`)

- One flat card, centred (the template's: no `elevation`); the preference controls above. Under
  the card, one link to the repository. The template's third-party sign-in, forgotten password,
  sign-up and terms do not exist for cliproxy and are left out.
- Inside the card, top to bottom: brand mark and name; h1 "Connect to this server"; a status line
  (lamp, host, and whether `GET /healthz` answers, rechecked every 10 s while the tab is shown);
  the key field with a show/hide button (`InputGroup`); the primary Connect button; the help as a
  closed `Collapsible`.
- Connect is never greyed out. With an empty field it focuses the field and shows the field's
  error; while signing in it shows Astryx's busy state and one press sends one request. Enter in
  the field submits through `onEnter`, which ignores Enter that commits an IME conversion.
- Sign-in errors are the field's error status, so the field describes them (`aria-describedby`).

### Pages

- Every page renders in one frame component, `src/app/PageFrame.tsx`, after the nbcards admin's
  (card-v2 `web/src/ui/PageFrame.tsx`, MIT): `Layout height="fill"` with the page padding set once
  on the `Layout`, `LayoutHeader`, `LayoutContent` and, for a detail or a rail, `LayoutPanel` at
  the end. A page puts its template's body inside it and never draws its own header (owner,
  2026-11-08: 「每個頁面一個骨架有病」, after the h1 jumped between pages). The header and the
  content share one line, so the h1 sits at the same place on every page; the content line stops at
  the content width, and a reading-width page caps only its content, aligned to the header's
  start, never centred.
- The header holds the h1, one supporting line (held empty while the page's line waits for its
  data, so nothing moves), the page's controls and at most one primary action. A list's search
  and filters sit in the `LayoutHeader` (as `table-filter` does), so they stay while the content
  scrolls; on phones they fold as the template's narrow layout folds them
  (`table-filter:2034-2088`). A rarely used action (Clear) goes into a menu. A route's views are
  side-nav items, never a tab strip in the header.
- A page hosted by a route renders through `PageHostContext` (`src/app/pageHost.ts`): as a tab,
  its frame takes the route's title, tabs and controls; in a dialog, it draws only its controls
  and body under the dialog's title.
- The body is header plus one or two sections. More goes into header tabs, a 340 px side column
  (`layout.sideColumn`) or paging at 20 rows.
- Headings: h1 the page; h2 `SectionHeading` (`src/components/`) for a section outside cards; h3
  `CardHeading` inside a card; h4 a sub-block. Never two headings stacked. A key number is a
  `MetricCard` (label row, value at the metric size, optional badge, one supporting line; with
  `href` the whole card is the link, marked by a chevron). All three follow card-v2 `web/src/ui/`.
- Cards have one style (radius 16, hairline border, the card padding) and hold only a few related
  facts or a chart. Lists, tables, settings and logs are flat with hairline dividers, never boxed.
- The outcome of a page action is a toast, or a banner directly under the header for a read.
- Collections are rows, not cards. Accounts and Logs are virtualized with
  `@tanstack/react-virtual` (as `LogRows.tsx` does; the templates do not virtualize).
- Low-frequency detail (raw JSON, empty groups, import forms) starts collapsed or lives in the
  detail panel.
- The preferences dialog's About panel lists the build and the server in one `MetadataList`: version,
  commit, build time, config layout, routing strategy, auth directory, remote management (a lamp
  with its word) and dashboard source; a value the server does not send reads "Not reported". It
  ends with the release check, whose outcomes are: up to date (`success`), update available with a
  link to the releases (`info`), cannot compare (`info`), no release published yet (`info`; the
  server's 502 `invalid_response`), checks disabled (`info`), anything else an error banner with
  Retry.

### Roles

A role that repeats across pages has one value. Sizes, spacing, type, radii, control heights,
heading levels, card use and link colour come from the nbcards admin (card-v2, MIT, the owner's
project; owner, 2026-11-08: 「大小統一東西多現在顯得亂你懂吧」「看看nbcards的後臺」), measured in
`p3/r/ref/nbcards/REPORT.md`; colours stay Rosé Pine. The Astryx templates settle the rest.
Spacing and sizes inside one template's own composition (its gaps, a toolbar's `size="sm"`) stay
as that template writes them. Values are in `src/themes/site/roles.ts` and `layout.ts`; `check:ui`
enforces the type rows and `npm run measure` the rendered values.
A template's typography value (`Text size="sm"`, for example) enters a page only after it is
added to `roles.ts` with a named use and its source, so text stays one scale across pages.

| Role | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Page frame | `Layout` / `LayoutHeader` / `LayoutContent` / `LayoutPanel`, padding set once on `Layout` | card-v2 `PageFrame.tsx`; `dashboard-alert-rail:1446-1567`, `table-filter:4333-4480` |
| Header | Every route has a `LayoutHeader` with a divider holding the h1 (26/600) and one 13 px `Text type="supporting"` line; the h1 is at the same place on every route. `table-page` and `settings-sidebar` have no header (`:856-869`, `:301`); their pages add one, a recorded deviation | card-v2 `PageFrame.tsx`; REPORT.md "h1" |
| Page padding | 6 (24 px), 4 (16 px) below Astryx `md`; the body ends with 10 (40 px) | card-v2 `PageFrame.tsx` |
| Content width | The content line takes the full width (no 1440 cap, unlike card-v2: it left empty bands on wide screens). Settings pages cap their content at 1200, single-column forms at 800; lists and dashboards take the full line | card-v2 `PageFrame.tsx` `CONTENT_WIDTH`; `settings-sidebar:303`, `form-wizard-inline:610` |
| Section gap | 6 (24 px) between a page's sections | card-v2 `layout.ts` `SECTION_GAP` |
| Card gap | 4 (16 px) between cards and between blocks inside one card | card-v2 `layout.ts` `CARD_GAP` |
| Card | One style: `Card` with radius 16, hairline border, padding 5 (20 px). Only for a few related facts or a chart | card-v2 `layout.ts` `CARD_PADDING`, `UI-RULES.md` |
| Side column | 340 px beside the main column | card-v2 `layout.ts` `SIDE_WIDTH` |
| Table density | `balanced`; `table-filter`'s density switch (`:3896`) is removed, a recorded deviation | `table-inbox:2628`, `table-grouped:953`, `table-page:933` |
| Heading levels | 1 page title, 2 `SectionHeading` outside cards, 3 `CardHeading` inside, 4 a sub-block; nothing deeper; one level 1 per route; never two headings stacked | card-v2 `UI-RULES.md` "Page" |
| Text types | `body` content and cells (15); `supporting` the line under a title and hints (13); `label` a field or metric label; `display-3` a metric value (31/600); `code` identifiers (model IDs, keys, paths) as plain mono text; versions and other numbers take `body` with tabular figures. The `Code` chip (filled, padded) is only for code inside a sentence or a snippet, never in a table cell, list row or metadata value (owner, 2026-11-08: 「組件庫包那麼死嗎？」 on version chips); `inherit` text inside another text. A `Heading` takes no `type`: its level sets the scale | card-v2 `MetricCard.tsx`, `panelScale`; `table-grouped:777`, `dashboard-alert-rail:1461`, `:863`, `dashboard-comparison:389` |
| Text size and weight | Size: `lg` for the brand name only. Weight: `semibold` for emphasis, `bold` for the brand and a group name, `normal` as the plain branch of a conditional emphasis. Rendered weights are 400/500/600 | `login-card:94`, `dashboard-alert-rail:1098`, `table-grouped:1001`, `table-inbox:1059` |
| Primary action | At most one `Button variant="primary"` per page, default size (36 px), at the header's end; the other header controls are 36 too | card-v2 `UI-RULES.md` "Buttons", `panelShared` |
| Row actions | `IconButton variant="ghost" size="sm"`: 32 × 32 with a 16 px glyph | card-v2 `UI-RULES.md`; `table-inbox:1008`, `table-filter:2159` |
| Nav row | 36 px, 16 px icon and text | REPORT.md "Nav" |
| Links | Body text colour, no underline; a chevron, the hover and the button shape show what is clickable; navigation is a link, an action is a button | card-v2 `siteTheme.ts` (text accent is the ink), `UI-RULES.md:55` |
| Numbers | Every numeric column and metric value: `Text hasTabularNumbers`; a metric value is `Text type="display-3" hasTabularNumbers`, never a heading | card-v2 `MetricCard.tsx`; `dashboard-comparison:703`, `table-page:503` |
| Charts | Two series at most, 2 px lines or bars, horizontal grid only, no dots; plot 14rem, 12rem on a phone; the legend is one text row | card-v2 `TrendChart.tsx`, REPORT.md "Charts" |
| Detail panel | `LayoutPanel` behind a `ResizeHandle`, 380 px (320 to 560), padding 0. Below the compact query (`(max-width: 768px), (max-width: 1024px) and (pointer: coarse) and (hover: none)`) a `BottomSheet height="tall" padding={0}` | `table-filter:2229`, `:4300`, `:4313`, `:1129` |
| Skeleton | Each region renders `Skeleton`s in the shape and size of its content, as `table-filter`'s loading rows do; a refetch keeps the previous data on screen | `table-filter:1882-1945` |

Measured limits (`npm run measure`, plan section 八): CLS during load ≤ 0.02; the first region
moves ≤ 2 px from its skeleton to its content; each route's answer element (Overview's first
attention card or its all-clear line, for example) is inside 1440×900 and 390×844. Every measured route declares
its answer selector and the measurements its page draws (table rows, header buttons, row actions,
skeleton); a missing declaration or a declared measurement with no sample fails, and so do
buttons of one role whose heights differ within a route. A route whose content still awaits its
rewrite (R1 to R5, `pending` in `tools/measure/run.mjs`) must hold the frame's roles; its load
limits are reported without failing and it answers with its h1 until the rewrite gives it an
answer.

### Keyboard

As the templates do it: each row is one tab stop and Enter or Space opens its detail
(`table-inbox:1109-1125`, `table-filter:2754-2762`). Astryx Table has no arrow-key movement
between rows, and none is added. Ctrl/Cmd+K opens "Go to page"; the shortcuts are listed in the
settings dialog.

## Components

| Need | Use |
|---|---|
| Account, key, model, plugin, log rows | One `Row` pattern on Astryx `List`/`Table`: status lamp + label, name + secondary line, metrics, row menu |
| Detail | Astryx `LayoutPanel` + `MetadataList`; `BottomSheet` on phones (Roles) |
| Edits | Astryx `Dialog purpose="form"`; config edits show a diff and reread before write |
| Quota windows | Astryx `ProgressBar` with label and reset time |
| Traffic per source (20 × 10 min) | The `dashboard-alert-rail` template's own `UptimeStrip`: one cell per bucket, neutral volume, gold or love by failure share, accessible summary |
| Charts | See Charts |
| Writes | Busy button, one write at a time, success toast, failure toast that stays with the server's text; deletes confirm in `AlertDialog` |
| Notices | See below |

## Notifications

| Level | Meaning | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `success` | An action the user started finished | Toast, auto-dismiss |
| `info` | Neutral fact the user should know now | Toast, auto-dismiss |
| `warning` | Something works but needs attention (account cooling, setting ignored by this server) | Banner on the page. A lasting state (an account cooling) is rendered by the page from its data and stays while the state lasts; a warning sent through `notify()` is an event and stays until dismissed or the page changes |
| `error` | An action failed or a read failed | Banner for reads; toast that stays for a failed action |

`notify()` accepts only these four levels. Toasts sit at the bottom end, one at a time.

## Motion

Press feedback, toast enter/exit, panel open/close, lamp pulse on live things (log tail, OAuth
waiting, live usage). No page transitions, no row entrance stagger: a list that refreshes every
10 s must not move.

## Charts

- Charts use recharts, as nine Astryx templates do (`dashboard/page.tsx:20`,
  `dashboard-alert-rail/page.tsx:60-68`); Astryx has no chart component. All charts live in one
  module (`src/components/charts/`), structured after card-v2's chart set (`charts.tsx`,
  `TrendChart.tsx`, `LegendDot.tsx`, `MetricCard.tsx`, `focusRing.ts`).
- Colours are theme tokens passed as CSS variables (`dashboard-alert-rail:697-730`): series take
  `--color-data-categorical-*`, defined in the theme as Rosé Pine colours; failure stays gold and
  love. No hex or px fallbacks in chart code.
- `isAnimationActive` is off on every series: the 10 s poll must not replay an animation.
- Hover or focus shows a point's tooltip and the arrow keys step through points; a mouse click
  draws no browser outline, keyboard focus draws Astryx's focus ring.
- Geometry after the nbcards admin (card-v2 `TrendChart.tsx`): two series at most, 2 px lines or
  bars, grid lines across the value axis only (horizontal in a time chart), no dots. The plot is
  14rem high, 12rem on a phone (`chartPlot` in `src/themes/site/charts.ts`); a bar list grows with
  its rows instead. The legend is one text row. Two chart cards side by side align at the top and keep their own heights.
- Charts draw only what the API has: total and failed requests over 200 minutes (Overview), source
  comparison and failure rate (Activity, Usage tab). The templates' 1h / 1d / 7d windows are dropped.
  Each chart has a one-line written conclusion beside it.
- KPI tiles (`MetricCard`) appear where the page's template has them: Overview and Activity's Usage tab.

## Not doing

- No gradients, glass or glow.
- No top bar: the brand is the side nav's heading and the page title is the page's h1.
- No custom selected-item decoration and no style overrides on Astryx navigation components, or
  on any component: the theme sets tokens only (gate: `check:ui`, a `components` block in a
  theme source fails).
- No disabled-grey primary buttons: a primary action stays pressable and explains itself (focus
  and a field error, or a banner) instead of greying out.
- No long explanatory paragraphs above data: one supporting line under the title; anything more
  is a collapsed section or one muted note after the data.
- No accent hue beyond iris in its two places (links, focus ring); the primary button stays ink.
- Icons are the component library's defaults and no app registry: a semantic name from the theme
  where one fits the meaning (`calendar`, `wrench`, `search`, `copy`, `check`, `eyeSlash` ...; the
  list is `npx astryx docs icons available-names`), otherwise a lucide component passed straight to
  `Icon` or an `icon` prop and typed with Astryx's `IconProps["icon"]`. No `registerIcons`, no second
  icon set, and template icons (heroicons) become lucide. The brand mark is lucide `Network` in the
  text colour with no tile behind it, in the side nav, on the sign-in card and in
  `public/favicon.svg` (gate: `check:ui`, any `<svg>`, `<path>` or `registerIcons` fails).
- No per-page colours, spacings or font sizes: the Roles table holds the one value per role.
