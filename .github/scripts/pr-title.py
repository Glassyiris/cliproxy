    pr-title.py 'fix(ui): keep Overview tiles whole'

The title is `type(scope): subject`, where type is a change category, scope is one of the
SCOPES below, and subject is an imperative phrase starting in lower case (a first word such as
`OAuth` or `TLS`, with a capital after its first letter, may keep its case) without a full stop.
The whole title fits in MAX_LENGTH characters, leaving room for the ` (#123)` GitHub appends.
