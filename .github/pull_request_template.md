- [ ] This branch is based on the current `master`.

- [ ] `cargo fmt --all --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings` and `cargo test --workspace --locked` pass, and the Verified section records any check I could not complete.
- [ ] I ran `npm run check`, `npm test` and `npm run build` in `ui/` when I changed the dashboard, and added every new string to the English, `zh-CN` and `zh-TW` catalogs.
- [ ] No real keys, tokens or account data appear in code, tests, logs or screenshots.
- [ ] I updated the docs when users see the change.
